# GitHub Repository Visualization Toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit is designed for analyzing and visualizing GitHub repositories' data. It includes two Python scripts that leverage the Plotly library to create interactive charts. These scripts are useful for individuals or teams interested in understanding trends and patterns in GitHub repositories across various programming languages.

### Features

1. `visualize_repos`: Generates a bar chart showing the most-starred projects on GitHub for a specified programming language.
2. `compare_languages`: Creates a line chart comparing the popularity (based on star count) of the top GitHub repositories across multiple programming languages.

## Installation

To use these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following packages:
- `plotly`
- `pandas`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install plotly pandas
```
